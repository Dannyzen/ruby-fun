This repo is for my random ruby projects

1 - File Copier
	Problem: I download zip files that create folders that contain mp3 files. I want these files to be moved automatically to my LAN file server.
	Solution: A script that (using a config file) copies all the files from a source to a destination folder, keeping the base directory names intact
